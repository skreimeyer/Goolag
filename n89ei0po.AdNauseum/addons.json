Like an ad-blocker, AdNauseam blocks malware and hides ads on the pages you visit. But AdNauseam does more, collecting each ad in its AdVault for you to interactively explore. AdNauseam can also be configured to automatically click each blocked ad in the background, polluting your data profile and frustrating the trackers who violate your privacy and facilitate bulk-surveillance agendas.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152878.png?src=api&modified=1425012549","width":"646","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152878.png?src=api&modified=1425012549","thumbnailWidth":"185","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"AdNauseam's advault interface..."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/153/153832.png?src=api&modified=1425012550","width":"576","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/153/153832.png?src=api&modified=1425012550","thumbnailWidth":"165","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"AdNauseam's menu interface"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/153/153830.png?src=api&modified=1425012550","width":"432","height":"429","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/153/153830.png?src=api&modified=1425012550","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"AdNauseam's logo"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adnauseam/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://adnauseam.io","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/667546/adnauseam-3.3.403-an+fx+sm+tb-linux.xpi?src=api","size":2579986,"developerComments":"It is best to remove or disable other adblockers (such as uBlock or Adblock Plus) as they may block ads before AdNauseam can identify or collect them","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adnauseam/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":49,"totalDownloads":99356,"weeklyDownloads":15213,"dailyUsers":11031,"updateDate":1500639879000,"supportURL":"https://adnauseam.io"}]}
